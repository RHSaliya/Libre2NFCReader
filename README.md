# Libre2NFCReader
This project is to get glucose data from libre2 sensor using NFC.

This a very simple java native android project to decrypt data of Libre2 sensor. This code works with FRAM data only and not BLE data (Maybe in future).

This code is extracted form the opensource iOS project DieBLE.
