# Libre2NFCReader
This project is to get glucose data from libre2 sensor using NFC.


This a very simple java native android project to decrypt data of Libre2 sensor. This code works with FRAM data only and not BLE data (Maybe in future).

I have exracted this code form the opensource iOS project DieBLE.

I hope this code can be helpful to you.
Happy coding!!!
